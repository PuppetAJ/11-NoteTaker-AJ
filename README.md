# Module 11 Note Taker Project


![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)


## Description

This is Adrian Jimenez's module 11 Note Taker challenge submission. 

I started this project off by first defining all the routes necessary for the app to be able to navigate across its pages, and manage the notes within db.json. Once that functionality was complete, I added a lib folder containing functions for manipulating the notes in db.json. These functions were then accessed by the respective api routes in my apiRoutes folder. After completing this, my app was almost functional, with the exception of a few bugs I had to fix. Once I felt the project was complete, I deployed it to heroku.
